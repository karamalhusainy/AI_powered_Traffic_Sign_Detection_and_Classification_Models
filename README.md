Traffic sign recognition is a crucial task in autonomous driving systems and advanced driver assistance 
systems (ADAS). Computer vision methods are varied in terms of accuracy and time taken to detect. Also, 
there is a lot of limitations in handling the complexities of traffic sign detection and classification due to 
variations in lighting conditions, and traffic sign designs. In this project we use two of the most common 
computer vision methods and put them on test the chosen methods are Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) and YOLOv5. Our approach involves training a CNN model on a large dataset of traffic sign 
images. The model will be designed to extract relevant features from input images and learn to differentiate 
between different traffic sign classes. The proposed system will leverage the power of deep learning to 
handle variations in traffic sign appearance, including variations in shape, colour, and size. As for the 
YOLOv5 model it was tuned and trained on the same dataset. After Both tested YOLOv5 has shown to be 
more robust and much faster than CNN. The used CNN model shows higher Accuracy 98% result while the 
YOLOv5 model showed 95% Accuracy.
